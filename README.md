# JapaneseParser

Web program that can take in sentences written in japanese and parse them to give definitions and information on vocabulary and grammar used in the setence in english.

At the moment the program does nothing however I plan to add server features including:
* Cleanly presented information on words, particles, ect. used in the sentence.
* Verb and adjective deconjugation. Finds the term's dictionary form and also tell you what the particular conjugation means.
* Visually appealing interface.
* Alrernitive intepretations for the sentence so the user can know if there are different ways a sentence can be intepreted.
